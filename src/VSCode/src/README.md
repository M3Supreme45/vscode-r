R language support 
This code is based on Microsoft R Tools for Visual Studio aka RTVS.
Please visit https://github.com/microsoft/rtvs for more information.
Prototype extension to VS Code can be found at RTVS repo. This project
is a personal effort and although it builds upon RTVS, it is not
supported by Microsoft. I only work on this occasionally in my spare time.
